                    <p>
                        Mircea is a fresh MSc graduate with a thirst for knowledge and thrill for new. He has been in the IT industry for about 3 years, and since then he has been involved in many activities that helped him grow both professionally and personally. He doesn't like strict rules, and considers that every issue has at least 3 or more ways of being solved. He is curious on a daily basis and likes to fiddle around with technology to further understand how does it work and why is it used. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        He has worked with different paradigms along the way, including OOP, Functional, Logical, and Reactive. His thirst does not stop here, and he is willing to learn about more and more pardigms, and eventually integrate them in new modules in his project or create his own personal projects with them. Lately he has caught interest in Esoteric Programming Languages and he thought they are quite fun to use. The issue is that most of them are cryptic and documentation is chaotic and spread all around the internet. Since he uses Udacity and Pluralsight really often, he would like to have a similar experience when it comes to learning Esoteric Languages, such as LOLCODE, Piet, Shakespeare or even Brainf*ck. 
                    </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>
                        He never backs down from a challenge, and he considers that he should learn as much as he can while he is young, so later as he ages, he could pass down all of his knowledge and share of enthusiasm to future generations of programmers and computer scientists. Time wasted is his biggest nemesis, and he can't stand when he doesn't have any tasks available at work, or he is blocked by something. During these moments, he changes his focus to something else, that still adds value towards his growth, like reading books, getting informed about new tech or working for something else. Beside Udacity and Pluralsight, he is subscribed to Tech newsletters, and he gets weekly, on his email the latest news about various technologies.

                    <p>
                        Julie comes from a family of business people: his father is one of the most influencial investors in the IT industry from Canada, contributing both financially and with functional ideas to big apps from all over the world, including Slack, Instagram and Udacity. Based on her parents' ideas, she started being interested in helping developers and companies develop applications that have a positive impact in the lives of many people. She has always been supported by her parents in her education and career, so she has travelled all around the world and studied at top schools. She rarely heard no from the people surrounding her, and she got used to getting whatever she wants most of the time. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        She's still remotely at the beginning of her career, with about 6 years in the industry, and she aims for the executive role anytime in the future. In the past she invested in applications from the vertical market of E-Health and Social Networking, now catching up some interest in the Educational market. She believes that the investments from the past have been a good call, with good reasons, since the applications have caught quite some success in Canada for the E-Health one and all over the world for the Social Network one. Having such a success in the former investments, she got a confidence boost and believes that her decisions in the functional side of the applications had a positive impact in their growth. She will be influenced by these past decisions, especially since they were aimed towards the usability and minimalism of the UI.
