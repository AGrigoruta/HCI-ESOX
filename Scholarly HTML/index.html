            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                EsoX (Esoteric Language User Experience), is a project that is meant to imagine various user experiences regarding multiple ways of 
                interaction with an esoteric programming language, plus activities of  (e.g., learning, programming, translating into a general purpose 
                language, research,...) and related tools like interpreters, compilers, development environments, notable applications, and others. 
                The developed application will also recommend other (esoteric) programming languages according to user preferences, language categories 
                (paradigm, usability, computational class, other features), pragmatic usages, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The requirements for the first part of the project presentation are as fallows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimum 3 ideas/concepts regarding the project design (including the sketches, wireframes, storyboards and, optionally, prototypes), plus the intermediary stages of the project development. Also, the team should provide the documentation – as Scholarly HTML – regarding interaction design patterns used in the wireframes/prototypes.</li>

                <li>Minimum 3 real examples concerning the QOC method. These examples could also give the motivation for choosing a certain idea/concept.</li>

                <li>The 4 mandatory HTML5 persona documents, for various personas interacting to the system.</li>

                <li>The project identity and the most significant details regarding the branding process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Given the short but wide description there is a lot of room to maneuver so first thing we should narrow down the requirmeents to something that can 
                be managed.
            </p>
            <img alt="extract requirements">
            <p>
                To summarize the content of the image:  Esox mission is to offer new ways of interaction in order to learn programming or to program. This will be done
                by creating new tools or enhancing existing ones and by exploring diffrent "cultures" of giving introduction to machines.

            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <p>
                In this section will take a look at logo,  color scheme, text font-family and font-size (with scaling).
            </p>
            <h3>Idea 1</h3>
            <img alt="Creation of Logo" src="./img/pg2-l.jpg">

            <p>
                Esoteric languages, are language that have to real use for most of humanity. They are made for fun in order to prove a point or to explore new concepts, but
                most of the time they are made just because. If we are to look however at the vast majority they are made for fun. As such the logo incorporates a emoji >_ 
                plus a slice of a lemon. The use of <strong>>_</strong> will also creat a link to the command line icon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The slice of lemon is a throwback at the logo from <a href="https://esolangs.org/" itemprop="url">Esolang</a>.

            <img alt="Color scheem" src="./img/pg2-r.jpg">
            <img alt="Color scheem" src="./img/pg3-l.jpg">
            <p>
                For colors we have picked, purble as main color, fallow by hot pink for accent, light green and yellow.
                Color can be seen at <a href="http://paletton.com/#uid=74H0C0k-et+ksEsm-FhhxshiYoA" itemprop="url">Paletton</a>

            <p>
                For easy reading we picked Share Tech. and for titles we picked Audiowide.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Share Tech', sans-serif;">
                Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
                For titles we picked Audiowide.
            </p>
            <h1 style="font-family: 'Audiowide', cursive;">A shining crescent far beneath the flying vessel.</h1>
            <p>For font scale and it can be in the current page but also at <a itemprop="url" href="http://type-scale.com/?size=16&scale=1.618&text=A%20Visual%20Type%20Scale&webfont=Audiowide%2BShare%2BTech&font-family=%27Share%20Tech%27%2C%20sans-serif&font-weight=400&font-family-headers=&font-weight-headers=inherit&background-color=white&font-color=%23333">type-scale.com</a></p>
            <h3>Idea 2</h3>
            <p>
                For the logo, we'll combine the most popular esoteric languages into one logo: so BrainFuck is a must, and added upon it we have LOLCODE, Shakespeare and Piet:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        BrainFuck is most known for its minimalistic symbol syntax so we could use some of its symbols
                    </li>
                    <li>
	                    LOLCODE is known for cat memes on the internet so we could use cat ears or whiskers or something that represents a cat
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shakespeare is known for the theatre script-like syntax, so we could use something that represents theatre and art, perhaps a manuscript or feather
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And last but not least, Piet is known for the color-coded blocks, so we could include exactly that
                    </li>
                </ul>
            The process of creating the final logo was the following:
            <img style="display:block" alt="Creation of Logo" src="./img/logoGrigi1.png">
            <img style="display:block" alt="Creation of Logo" src="./img/logoGrigi2.png">
            <img style="display:block" alt="Creation of Logo" src="./img/logoGrigi3.png">
            <img style="display:block" alt="Creation of Logo" src="./img/logoGrigi4.png">
            <img style="display:block" alt="Creation of Logo" src="./img/logoGrigi5.png">
            <img style="display:block" alt="Creation of Logo" src="./img/logoGrigi6.png">
            </p>
            <p>
                As for colors, we have to inspire the user to learn, be creative and get curious.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Orange  - inspires optimism, adventure, creativity and fun and it can be used in products to stimulate, express freedom and fascinate which is exactly what we want to achieve with EsoX 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lime Green  - inspires growth, harmony and kindness and it can be used to encourage the user to learn in his own way, creating his own personal balance with the knowledge he will assimilate, everything in a friendly environment
                </li>
                <li>
                    Yellow  - inspires enthusiasm, happiness, opportunity and curiosity. It can be used to stimulate the user in getting curious with the app, and explore freely the service we will offer to him with full enthusiasm and energy
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dark Grey  - contrast with all these warm colours
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The fonts we use should be friendly, easy to read and have support for i18n, since we aim for accesibility and ease of use by most users from all around the world.<br>
                The primary font is PT Sans, it has support for other languages like cyrilic and greek so i18n would work for the majority of the users in the Americas, Europe, Australia and most of Africa. PT Sans does not have support for Asian languages but we could have different font families for these specific unicodes.<br>
                The secondary font is Raleway. According to Google’s Pairing functionality, it works together with PT Sans. It does not have support for special unicode characters but we could have a fallback with other similar fonts for those exact unicode ranges, like Comfortaa<br>
                For the code snippets we must use a monospace font to have a clear and readable text, and Inconsolata is a widely used font for code snippets world wide.<br>
                For the font scaling, perhaps the golden ratio would work here: The Perfect Fourth Scale, which is basically a multiplier of 1.333 starting from 16 px. So the paragraph would have 16 px, h6 -> 21.33px, h5 -> 28.43px, h4 -> 37.90 px, h3 -> 50.52px, h2 -> 67.34px, h1 -> 89.76px

                        <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                        <p>Every day Stefan interacts with code, through IDE's or white boards or pen and paper. He has already established a process of
                            writing each feature he will deliver for the customers. Each time he has a small session of looking up in the existing code,
                            he says this is a must in order to understand the current state and logic of the code, where he wants, needs, to implement the 
                            new functionality. After that he will write a small flow diagram to check what components are need it and how the "data" flows.
                            Then he writes the code and after all is done he tests. 
                        </p>
                        <p>All that process dose not guarantee success but, Stefan says, it increases the chances of not having bugs in the code. If there are bugs
                            he will have to manualy check each state of code to see what happens (most of the times this is done mentally).
                        </p>
                        <p>He enjoys trying to write in different paradigmes, if the code is more data diven he will write it functionaly, if the functionality is simple
                            and the code needs to be delivered fast or is a prototype most of the time procedural will be the way to go. To add structure to data OOP is 
                            the way to go. He also likes to toy with should i use "composition or inheritance".
                        </p>
                        <p>Stefan said he has multiple accounts to sites like FrontendMasters and Brilliant or Egghead. He says that is the only way he can keep up with the 
                            changes in his field. At the same time he feels that most of the changes that come are just "more of the same with small nuances".

                        <p>
                            Mircea is a fresh MSc graduate with a thirst for knowledge and thrill for new. He has been in the IT industry for about 3 years, and since then he has been involved in many activities that helped him grow both professionally and personally. He doesn't like strict rules, and considers that every issue has at least 3 or more ways of being solved. He is curious on a daily basis and likes to fiddle around with technology to further understand how does it work and why is it used. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            He has worked with different paradigms along the way, including OOP, Functional, Logical, and Reactive. His thirst does not stop here, and he is willing to learn about more and more pardigms, and eventually integrate them in new modules in his project or create his own personal projects with them. Lately he has caught interest in Esoteric Programming Languages and he thought they are quite fun to use. The issue is that most of them are cryptic and documentation is chaotic and spread all around the internet. Since he uses Udacity and Pluralsight really often, he would like to have a similar experience when it comes to learning Esoteric Languages, such as LOLCODE, Piet, Shakespeare or even Brainf*ck. 
                        </p>
                        <br> 
                        <p>
                            He never backs down from a challenge, and he considers that he should learn as much as he can while he is young, so later as he ages, he could pass down all of his knowledge and share of enthusiasm to future generations of programmers and computer scientists. Time wasted is his biggest nemesis, and he can't stand when he doesn't have any tasks available at work, or he is blocked by something. During these moments, he changes his focus to something else, that still adds value towards his growth, like reading books, getting informed about new tech or working for something else. Beside Udacity and Pluralsight, he is subscribed to Tech newsletters, and he gets weekly, on his email the latest news about various technologies.

                        <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                        <p>A day in Iulia life is like a sprint with obstacles, a sprint within a maraton (1 year cycle) in which she has to deliver the condensed curriculum
                        while keeping the students intrested and answering all the question that are throw her way. Her students are very different in the way they understand 
                        the content so it's always challenging  to try and fit the content such that everyone understands.</p>
                        <p>Over the years she has found out that having more then one way to solve a problem and to represent it is the best way to go in teaching it to the kids.
                            For example in order to solve recursion they use a state table where each state of the recursion is marked and removed once the cycle is done. Or for
                            representing the swapping between 2 values they use actual objects like 3 cans and so own.
                        </p>
                        <p>She says she always looks to teach the students to experimet, "they need to have a flexible and agile mind and I have to come up with ways to help them".
                            In previous years she added, even if it's not in the curriculum C# and F# and they proved to be really fun and intriguing for the students and herself.
                            "The fact that they were able to visualise what they build. Not just some text on the screen but buttons and icons and such made the students really happy".
                            And the intresting part is that Iulia didn't had any prior knowlged of C# or F# but she did it for her students.
                        </p>
                        <p>Even if C# and F# had some good results they are close to C languages and now she hopes she can find something different to continue her experiment.</p>

                        <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                        <p>Bogdan day starts usualy by reading his email, and answering to most urgent issues. Then he check with the project owner to see if the priorities are still the same. He then
                            moves on to his assigned tasks. To solve this he consults with the business analyst, in order to have a good grasp on the subject, "this helps me to make design decisions
                            that will help further down the line". On his desk you can find 2 books, one is Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software and Introduction to Algorithms (MIT Press).
                            He said he read them multiple times over the time of his career and it always helped him when he head to solve a though problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As my career progressed I've always tryed to help my peers to better understand how to structure the code in a natural way. "For me this always came easy, and so I want to share
                            my knowlged in the hopes that it will help my peers write better code, and in doing so having a better product". When he was younger Bogdan experimented with multiple paradigmes of
                            writing code, but as his senior, back then, advised him," I came to see that modeling the world should be in a 1 to 1 relation with the code it's only natural that we think in objects".
                            Paradigmes like Functional programming or Procedural or Logic are not natural, in his opinion, "They are intresting and a real brain workout but they don't solve with grace real world problems".
                        </p>
                        <p> As a professional Bogdan alawyas tries to stay on top of things so he reads about the advances in industry, any new book or accredited (form well established entities) workshop is wellcome. "I have 
                            to keep up with the changes in order to better solve the tasks that come my way. It is funny how ever how hard is to find something trully new - the older I get the harder is to not find patterns when
                            a new 'technology', somehow I can see the shorcomes almost immediately. I'm not going to say OOP is purfect but it's the best thing we have at the moment that is why I'm still looking".

                        <p>
                            Silviu's started as a software developer focusing mostly on the functionality of the application without much interest in graphical design and graphical interfaces. He cares only for the algorithms and the coding standards that already exist. He prides himself on learning the ins and outs of a single coding language at a time so that he isn't taken by surprise no matter what is thrown at him. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            After multiple years in the field he decided to switch over to being a software arhitect because of his thrist for stability in software developement and the rigurous conventions that govern this step of software developement. He made this change because he was tired of clients asking for certain coding languages even though the same features could be achieved using a stable and widely used one. 
                        </p>
                        <br> 
                        <p>
                            These days he focuses solely on the foundation of the applications without caring about the language used for the implementation as he finds those boring and pointless. With his new career path he finds enjoyment in what he does, focusing on just making the application work and not how this is achieved through the actual coding.

                        <p>Iulia is a student at High School Grigore Moisil, as such her schedule is from 8 to 13 each day, 5 days a week. She enjoys the practical side
                            of things, she likes anything that has to do with actual real life experimentation. In her own words "if it's visual then I can reason about it".
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the best places, she says, is the High School lab of Informatics. Her teacher has an unusal way of teaching the curriculum, he uses real life objects,
                            like small cubs of different sizes and colors and applys most of the algorithms. Most of the curriculum materials will be created by the students, and that 
                            is the part Iulia likes the most. "It's the fact that you can see how and where each pice goes - you don't have to keep that in your head, we even creat shapes 
                            and arrows to draw logical diagrams".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She likes to apply the things she learns in the informatic class in other class also, it can help her to understand better the subject. It also helped her solve
                            problems she though she had no idead how to solve, because it gave her courage to try new ways of solving the issue without thinking that she "might fail". "It is
                            really hard to explain the feeling of joy when you solve a problem that you had no idea how to approach initially".

                        <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                        <p>
                            Julie comes from a family of business people: his father is one of the most influencial investors in the IT industry from Canada, contributing both financially and with functional ideas to big apps from all over the world, including Slack, Instagram and Udacity. Based on her parents' ideas, she started being interested in helping developers and companies develop applications that have a positive impact in the lives of many people. She has always been supported by her parents in her education and career, so she has travelled all around the world and studied at top schools. She rarely heard no from the people surrounding her, and she got used to getting whatever she wants most of the time. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            She's still remotely at the beginning of her career, with about 6 years in the industry, and she aims for the executive role anytime in the future. In the past she invested in applications from the vertical market of E-Health and Social Networking, now catching up some interest in the Educational market. She believes that the investments from the past have been a good call, with good reasons, since the applications have caught quite some success in Canada for the E-Health one and all over the world for the Social Network one. Having such a success in the former investments, she got a confidence boost and believes that her decisions in the functional side of the applications had a positive impact in their growth. She will be influenced by these past decisions, especially since they were aimed towards the usability and minimalism of the UI.

            <h3>Idea 2</h3>
            <p><b>Q1: How do we gratify the user’s progress and motivate him to learn more?</b></p>
            <img alt="QOC Grigi 1 " style="max-width: 600px" src="./img/QOC 1.png">
            <p>As a solution, we could implement both achievements/badges in the user profile and also progress bars on every Esoteric Language. The incentives could be a great idea to motivate and reward, but for digital incentives we depend on third party providers (like having Amazon/any other e-store wallet credit) and for physical incentives we have to manage user addresses and deliveries, and issues could arise from the delivery process itself so big exclamation mark in the feasibility criteria.</p>
            <p><b>Q2: How will the user navigate through the application?</b></p>
            <img alt="QOC Grigi 2 " style="max-width: 600px" src="./img/QOC 2.png">
            <p>We could either implement the breadcrumbs and menus to navigate back and forward which will be rather static on the dashboard, so the user will always know his navigation location, and have a screen which changes the content according to the clicks (easier to navigate with the mouse), or we could implement tabs and cards and have a more game-like dashboard (easier to navigate with the game controller). For the speech navigation, this also enables the use of the app for people without an available mouse/keyboard, so they could use it with their voice and perhaps integrate it with their smart speakers (Alexa, Google Home, etc.)</p>
            <p><b>Q3: How will the application form a community and create some level of competitivity between users?</b></p>
            <img alt="QOC Grigi 3" style="max-width: 600px" src="./img/QOC 3.png">
            <p>In order to motivate and instigate comptetitiveness between users, we could organise monthly/quarterly challenges and competitions, with a form of reward for the winners. If we want them to collaborate together, we could implement learning groups. This way they could learn faster from one another, while also competing to be the best group/ guild from the application, like in a MMORPG game. The leaderboards are also in the equation, and they would display the most hard-working users in the app, for the user to see and strive to take their place.</p>
