			<h3>Test Plan for: <span>EsoX</span></h3>
			
			<div class="usabilityTestBackground">				
				<h4>Persona Type Tested: <span>Primary/Secondary/Served</span></h4>
				<h5>Context: <span>A meeting room from the office</span> </h5>
				<h5>Duration: <span>10 minutes</span></h5>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestObjectives">
				<h5>Overall Objectives</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Assess the effectiveness of Esox by having users perform the main flows</li>
					<li>Identify obstacles to completing <strong>a certain task or using a certain component</strong>;</li>
					<li>Evaluate consistency and standards;</li>
					<li>Evaluate accessibility features</li>
					<li>Assess the user experience while using EsoX</li>
				</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestScenarios">
			<h5>Scenario</h5>
			<p>The user gets familiarized with a new application for educational purposes, EsoX, an application for learning Esoteric Programming Languages in a user friendly way, having all of these tutorials centralized in one place. They either want to learn something new and exciting, or they are just curious about what EsoX is all about. They will start navigating the application.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestDetails">
			<div class="detailsLeft">
				<h5>Tasks</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Task 1:</strong> <span>Log in the application, save an intermediate course and join a guild.</span> - <span>Estimated time: 3 minutes</span>;</li>
						<li><strong>Task 2:</strong> <span>Start a Piet tutorial and run a program.</span> - <span>Estimated time: 6 minutes</span>;</li>
						<li><strong>Task 3:</strong> <span>Start a Befunge tutorial, have a 500ms delay on, and run a program.</span> - <span>Estimated time: 5 minutes</span>;</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>Post-test Questions</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>How easy was the application to navigate through?</li>
						<li>How good were the tutorials explained?</li>
						<li>What would you improve to the overall functionality of the application?</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they are thinking, about the task or the product/application;</li>
					<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
					<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;</li>
					<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test Observations section accompanied by video/audio).</li>
					<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with: "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".</li>
