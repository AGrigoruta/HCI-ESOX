My name is <strong>Alex</strong> with the <strong>EsoX App</strong>.<strong>EsoX is an educational application, having tutorials for learning Esoteric Programming Languages a bit easier than you would do straing from the existing articles on the internet. We aim for teaching you new, out of ordinary, technologies, while keeping you engaged with a gamification design and community to learn from.</strong> Today we are looking for ways to improve the user experience of <strong>EsoX</strong>. This test is devised to evaluate with specific design components of the <strong>app</strong> and to discover any issues we need to address, we are not testing you.</p> 
		<p>Please speak all your thoughts aloud as you go through the tasks. This helps us better understand why you are making certain choices.</p>
		<p>If you find something difficult to use, chances are that others will as well. The study will take about <strong>(15 minutes)</strong>. We will answer any questions you have at the end of the study.</p>
		<p>Are there any questions regarding this test?</p>
